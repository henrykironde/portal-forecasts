#### [Portal Forecasting Website](http://portal.naturecast.org/)

This is the main repository for predictions made on the Portal rodent census data [Portal Project](http://portal.weecology.org/).

Predictions are made and archived weekly. Approximately once a month, one of these forecasts is made immediately prior to a new trapping session (trapping occurs as close to each new moon as possible).

## How to add a new model

For details on adding a model to the current set, see the [Adding a new model wiki page](https://github.com/weecology/portalPredictions/wiki/Adding-a-new-model).

## Docker builds

Forecasts are run using Travis CI based on a docker image. This makes the builds
faster and more reproducible. When adding new packages to this repo it may be
necessary to update the Docker container using the following commands:

```
sudo docker build -t weecology/portal_predictions .
sudo docker push weecology/portal_predictions
```
