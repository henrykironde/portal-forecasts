# Ecological Forecasting

Most forecasts for the future state of ecological systems are conducted once and never updated or assessed. As a result, many available ecological forecasts are not based on the most up-to-date data, and the scientific progress of ecological forecasting models is slowed by a lack of feedback on how well the forecasts perform. Iterative near-term ecological forecasting involves repeated daily to annual scale forecasts of an ecological system as new data becomes available and regular assessment of the resulting forecasts. More regular updating and assessment will advance ecological forecasting as a field by accelerating the identification of the best models for individual forecasts and improving our understanding of how to best design forecasting approaches for ecology in general.

# [Weecology](http://weecology.org/) 

We are a group of ecologists at the University of Florida, comprised of [Ethan White's](http://whitelab.weecology.org/) and [Morgan Ernest's](http://ernestlab.weecology.org/) lab groups at the [University of Florida](http://www.wec.ufl.edu/). We are broadly interested in collaborative approaches to empirical and computation ecology, open science, and open data.

# The Portal Project

[The Portal project](http://portal.weecology.org/), located in the Chihuahuan desert of southern Arizona, is a long-term experimental monitoring project in desert ecology. Established in 1977 by Jim Brown, we have over 40 years of data on rodents, plants, ants, and weather at the site. Rodent data are collected approximately monthly, an ideal scenario for short-term forecasts of rodent abundance.
